# Cubist - 3Ã—3 Rubik's Cube Solver & Tutor

Cubist is a comprehensive desktop application for solving and learning 3Ã—3 Rubik's Cube puzzles. Built with Python and PySide6, it offers multiple solving algorithms, 3D visualization, and educational features.

## Developerâ€™s Story
When I started this project, I was 13 years old, during the 2021 COVID-19 pandemic. At that time, I was trying to solve a Rubikâ€™s Cube, but I was never successful, which made me feel quite frustrated. Motivated by this challenge, I decided to develop a Rubikâ€™s Cube solver. 
I created the first version in 2021. Later, in 2025, I revisited the project, improved it significantly, and prepared it for public release.

### ðŸŽ¯ Multiple Solving Algorithms
- **Fast Solver**: Uses Kociemba's two-phase algorithm for optimal solutions
- **Tutor Solver**: Step-by-step beginner method (Layer-by-Layer) with explanations
- **Research Solver**: Advanced IDA* search algorithm for educational purposes

### ðŸŽ¨ Rich Visualization
- **3D Renderer**: Interactive OpenGL-based 3D cube with smooth animations
- **2D Net View**: Traditional cube net representation with highlighting
- **Animation Controls**: Play, pause, step-by-step, and speed control

### ðŸ“š Educational Tools
- **Step-by-step Tutorials**: Detailed explanations for each solving phase
- **Move Highlighting**: Visual feedback showing which pieces are affected
- **Progress Tracking**: Statistics and solve history

### ðŸ”§ Advanced Features
- **Scramble Generator**: WCA-compliant random scrambles
- **Manual Input**: Paint cube colors or enter facelet strings
- **Validation**: Comprehensive cube state validation with error reporting
- **Export Options**: Save solutions as PDF, JSON, or text files

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Windows 10/11 (primary target platform)

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages
- PySide6 (GUI framework)
- PyOpenGL (3D rendering)
- numpy (numerical computations)
- kociemba (fast solving algorithm)
- reportlab (PDF export)

## Usage

### Running the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

### Basic Workflow
1. **Input Cube State**:
   - Use the scramble generator for random puzzles
   - Paint colors manually using the color input panel
   - Enter facelet strings directly

2. **Choose Solver**:
   - **Fast**: For quick optimal solutions
   - **Tutor**: For learning step-by-step
   - **Research**: For algorithm exploration

3. **Solve and Learn**:
   - Watch 3D animations of the solution
   - Read step-by-step explanations
   - Control playback speed and direction

4. **Export Results**:
   - Save as PDF with detailed analysis
   - Export JSON for data processing
   - Generate text files for sharing

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+N`: New scramble
- `Ctrl+S`: Solve cube
- `Ctrl+R`: Reset to solved state
- `Space`: Play/pause animation
- `Left/Right Arrow`: Step through moves
- `Ctrl+E`: Export solution
